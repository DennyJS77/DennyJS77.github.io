					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The cloud storage market has become more popular in recent years and big name companies like Google, Microsoft and Dropbox have started to exert control over the market. I wanted create a cloud storage platform that would function as a workspace rather than a file storage and sharing platform </p>

				<div class="problem">
					<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p>Cloud storage platforms tend to only provide users with some of the features that they desire. This causes users to utilize multiple cloud storage platforms to accomplish their daily tasks.<br> </p>
				</div>
				<div class ="problem">
					<h2>Solution</h2>
					<p>Design a cloud storage platform that functions as a workspace giving users the ability to create, store, organize and share content with others as well as using a real-time collaboration space to work with other users.</p>

					<h2>UX Research</h2>
					<h3>Surveys</h3>
					<p>Understanding how people used their current cloud platforms along with complaints sand desired features laid the ground work for building the platform.</p>

				<div class="analysis">
					<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>Analysis of three competitors in the cloud storage market, Evernote, Dropbox and Google Drive found that Aurora had to differentiate itself from the competition by being a workspace and share space for users rather than just an online storage area.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="information">
					<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
					<img src="Images/userflowlaptop.png" width="418px" height="236px" alt="laptop showing user flows">
					<p>User stories were constructed based on new and the returning users. The stories where sorted into high, medium and low priority to help determine the features to be included in the cloud platform. After reviewing the user stories the main features to include were creating content, real-time collaboration and a sharing space for posting projects or portfolios.</p>
					<p>When developing the user flows I wanted to make them similar to other cloud storage platforms, so new users did not have a big learning curve when using this platform.</p>

					<h2>Branding</h2>
					<h3>Naming</h3>

					<p>The name of the cloud storage platform I decided on was Aurora. Aurora is the ancient Roman goddess of the dawn and in meteorology is a luminous phenomenon that consists of streamers or arches of light appearing in the upper atmosphere of a planet's magnetic polar regions and is caused by the emission of light from atoms excited by electrons accelerated along the planet's magnetic field lines.</p>
					
					<h3>Logo</h3>

					<p> I wanted the logo to symbolize the interaction of people and ideas on the site. I also wanted to integrate the logo within the word Aurora if possible. I contemplated two different fonts for the logo, Silom and Copperplate. I ended up going with Copperplate because I felt that it was a nice contrast from the roundness of the abstract letter a in the logo. For the color palette I leveraged the colors found in the aurora.</p>

					<h2>UI Design</h2>
				<img src="Images/UIpics.png" width="375px" height="900px" alt=" wireframes, first iteration user interface, second iteration user interface">
					<p>Now that all the user research has been collected the next step is to organize the content to build a great user experience.  Keeping the landing page and create account pages clean and easy to navigate was a priority. The dashboard was designed to be similar to other cloud platforms to limit the learning curve of new users. The sharespace page was designed to showcase the photos and projects of the user.</p>
			
					<p>Preference testing was conducted on typography and based upon the results the typography  was changed to an easy to read font. The reason for this change was because users are going to spend long periods of time on the site and they didnâ€™t want to be squinting and trying to decipher unusual fonts.  User testing  also validated that the current framework of the dashboard and sharespace was easy to navigate.</p>
						
					<p>Users also stated that they wanted a cohesive feel across all platforms. This included changing button colors so they were consistent across every screen. I also decided to incorporate the background image on all the desktop screens giving the website a cohesive feel across all the screens. The last round of user testing provided negative feedback on the use of the photo across all screens.</p>
					
					<p>The final prototype changed the screens to a cleaner easy to navigate style as originally planned in the wireframing stage.</p>
